# c4e-site
Demonstration for Clim4Energy project at http://c4e.fmi.fi/


The site displays with Leaflet javascript library maps and 
dygraph graphs depending on the point on the map chosen	by clicking in the map area.

map layers can be chosen from a	few options and are pulled from	a local smartmet server wms plugin
graphs are fixed for a set of parameters each with data being pulled from the smartmet server timeseries plugin

To use this base in other setups one needs to run an configure a smartmet server and point the uri in js/anim.$
